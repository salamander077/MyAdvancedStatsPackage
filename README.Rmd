# MyAdvancedStatsPackage

MyAdvancedStatsPackage is an R package designed for advanced statistical analysis. It provides a collection of functions and datasets to assist users in performing various statistical computations and analyses.

## Installation

You can install the package from GitHub using the `devtools` package:

```{r}
devtools::install_github("your_username/MyAdvancedStatsPackage")


```

##Functions
Mean Function
mean_function(x): Calculate the mean of a numeric vector x.

##Median Function
median_function(x): Calculate the median of a numeric vector x.

##Correlation Function
correlation_function(x, y): Calculate the correlation coefficient between two numeric vectors x and y.

##Datasets
Sample Data
sample_data: A sample dataset containing 10 observations of two variables, x and y.

##Usage
Here's a quick example of how to use the functions and datasets in MyAdvancedStatsPackage:

R
Copy code
# Load the package
library(MyAdvancedStatsPackage)

# Calculate the mean of a numeric vector
mean_value <- mean_function(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))

# Calculate the median of a numeric vector
median_value <- median_function(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5))

# Calculate the correlation coefficient between two vectors
correlation_coefficient <- correlation_function(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), c(5, 4, 3, 2, 1))

# Access the sample dataset
data(sample_data)

# View the structure of the sample dataset
str(sample_data)
